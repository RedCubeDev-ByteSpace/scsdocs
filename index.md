# Scrap Shell Docs
Scrap Shell is a very simplistic shell like language used by the ScrapMechanic mod [ScrapComputer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2634124102).  
The ScrapShell interpreter written in Lua can be found [here](https://github.com/RedCubeDev-ByteSpace/ScrapShellLua), and there is a [VScode Highlighting Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RedCubeDev.scrap-shell-language-support) available.
This Website will cover the Scrap Shell scripting language.
